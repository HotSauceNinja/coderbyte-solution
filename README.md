Here are my solutions for coding challenges in [coderbyte](https://www.coderbyte.com)

Hope you have fun with these coding challenges.

Keep updating.

## Easy:
- CheckNums
- Longest Word 
- Time Convert
- Alphabet Soup
- First Reverse
- Simple Adding
- Letter Changes
- Simple Symbols
- First Factorial
- Letter Capitalize
- Correct Path
  - I hate using bruteforce!

## Hard
- Kaprekars Constant 
- Chessboard Traveling
- Maximal Square
  - I think this one is very hard when it comes to matrix and filter, and how to handle filter movement within a matrix by pure code without using some matrix handling library.
  - Since coderbyte uses python2, and my own laptop uses python3, I have 2 version of the code. 
  - For python2 version, you can just copy and paste the code on to the [coderbyte online editor](https://www.coderbyte.com/information/Maximal%20Square) and test the code.
  - For python3, you can run it on your own computer. You need to copy and paste the test case on strArr, for example: `strArr = ["0111", "1111", "1111", "1111"]`
  - You can uncomment the `print()` to have a close monitor on how it works. Have fun!
- Pentagonal Number
  - Although it is a hard challenge, it is not hard at all. All you need to do is to find the regular pattern of how the pentagon grows.
